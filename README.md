Worth can get recommend index for you from your enter item, It will analyze you from the following aspects:
1. Whether the price is less than the average price of the monthly expenditure of the same item, importance: 35%.
2. Is the price less than all the monthly expenses of the same project, importance: 20%.
3. Whether the price is less than the monthly disposable amount, importance: 35%.
4. Frequency of use, importance: 35%.
5. Commodity life, importance: 5%.

I know everyone has their own opinion on this, but I'm going to try to be as objective as possible.
If you have scientific data for me, welcome PR, Thanks.
